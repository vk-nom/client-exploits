# Client Exploits
Current + Updating Client Exploits, will be posting when I can get my shit together (this is an open source project by the Anomaly team, enjoy!)


# Shoot Through Walls:

This is an old p2c exploit from a few months ago that is exploiting the currentPlayerVM(VM = VeiwMatrix) allowing the bullet to spread using game runtime memory. This is highly outdated, you will need to update both the view matrix and the signatures/offsets/pointers/addresses needed to use this exploit.
